                    <p> 
                        We are a platform based in Arunachal Pradesh developed specifically for music and podcasts in indigenous dialects/languages. Being from a small indigenous society we understand the trouble of  promoting and producing indigenous music in a country dominated by western and Bollywood music. We understand the need to change yet also stay true to our roots and that is why we want all regional artist to have a platform to keep their passion and art alive. Popil began from the need to preserve, hone and evolve and also to support and nurture the seeds of the future that will help regional songs attain its place and recognition in the pages of the book of music.
                    </p>

                        Our library features a variety of regional artists who have made a name for themselves or are looking to do so in the coming days. The songs in our library have been re-mastered and are available in the highest quality; Making us one of the only applications in the region to create a High-Definition Digital Library. In this highly competitive world of music, we are committed to bringing out regional artists. To value, archive, and make accessible to our people.
